//  ViewControllerMain.swift
//  RPG Maker MZ Framework for Xcode 12
//
//  Created by Giancarlos Alvarado on 2/6/21.
//
// This file represents the first ViewController that launches with the app. From here you have the option of creating your own custom pre-app menu in Xcode and Swift.
// With this framework, it is possible to include features such as multiple RPG Maker games in one app and theoretically add features such as in-app purchasing, subscriptions, etc., before the RPG Maker MZ game actually launches.
